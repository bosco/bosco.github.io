        <h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>With the basics of the jr network established (see
<a href="https://using.tech/posts/jr_1">Introducing jr: A Peer-to-Peer Social Network</a>), I wanted to
simulate the growth of the extended network and find a mathematical model
that describes this growth.</p>
<p><code>core/extended-network-test</code> builds a test network of 100 nodes each
following 10 random nodes. It then performs 1000 random syncs (two nodes chosen
at random sync with each other) and records the average extended network size at
each iteration. The output can be found in
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rxt1077/jr/master/data/extended_growth.csv">data/extended_growth.csv</a>.
Graphing the output with <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">gnuplot</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> yields:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rxt1077/jr/master/data/extended_growth.png" alt="Extended Network Growth"></p>
<h2 id="fitting-the-generalized-logistic-function">Fitting the Generalized Logistic Function</h2>
<p>The graph appears to be a representation of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_logistic_function">generalized logistic function</a>
which is fairly standard for systems that grow organically. The simplest form
that fits our data is:</p>
<p>$$ Y(t) = A + \frac{K-A}{1+e^{-B(t-M)}} $$</p>
<p>Where $ A $ is the lower asymptote, $ K $ is the upper asymptote, $ B $ is the
growth rate and $ M $ is the time at which the maximum growth rate occurs.</p>
<p>Using $ n $ for the total number of nodes and $ f $ for the number of nodes
each node follows (as passed to <code>sim/boostrap-network</code>) $ A $ and $ K $ can
be derived:</p>
<p>$$ A = f $$
$$ K = \min(n, f^2) $$</p>
<p>As a cost function I chose to use the sum of the squares of the residuals:</p>
<p>$$ ssr = \sum_{t=0}^{t=1000} (MeasuredValue[t] - Y(t))^2 $$</p>
<p>Where $ t $ is the number of random syncs that have been performed. This allows
us to have a measure of how far off our guess of $ B $ and $ M $ is with the
goal being to minimize the cost function. Since we are only dealing with two
features we can create a 3D plot of the cost function using <code>gradient/graph-ssr</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#b8860b">jr.core=&gt;</span> (<span style="color:#00a000">gradient/graph-ssr</span> <span style="color:#666">10</span> <span style="color:#666">100</span> (<span style="color:#00a000">gradient/read-csv</span> <span style="color:#b44">&#34;data/extended_growth.csv&#34;</span> <span style="color:#666">1</span>))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rxt1077/jr/master/data/ssr.png" alt="Cost Function"></p>
<p>As we can see from the graph, the minimum occurs around $ B = 0.01 $ and
$ M = 500 $. Using gradient descent, we will attempt to hone in on more precise
values<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Fortunately the partial derivatives are already worked out in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_logistic_function#Gradient_of_generalized_logistic_function">Wikipedia article</a>.
All we need to do is update them for our simplified sigmoid:</p>
<p>$$ \frac{\partial{Y}}{\partial{B}} = \frac{(K-A)(t-M)e^{-B(t-M)}}{(1+e^{-B(t-M)})^2} $$
$$ \frac{\partial{Y}}{\partial{M}} = -\frac{(K-A)Be^{-B(t-M)}}{(1+e^{-B(t-M)})^2} $$</p>
<p>Some great examples of taking partial derivatives of a least squares function
can be found
<a href="https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gradient_descent.html">here</a> and
<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-mathematics-behind-gradient-descent-dde5dc9be06e">here</a>.
The partial derivatives of our cost function with respect to $ B $ and
$ M $ would be:</p>
<p>$$ \frac{\partial{ssr}}{\partial{B}} = -2\sum_{n=0}^{1000}\frac{\partial{Y}}{\partial{B}} * ssr $$
$$ \frac{\partial{ssr}}{\partial{M}} = -2\sum_{n=0}^{1000}\frac{\partial{Y}}{\partial{M}} * ssr $$</p>
<p>The functions for the partial derivatives as well as for the gradient are
<code>gradient/pdb</code>, <code>gradient/pdm</code>, and <code>gradient/grad</code> respectively<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.
<code>gradient/descent-to</code> will perform a gradient descent algorithm with an
adaptive learning rate<sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> (taking iterations from an infinite, lazy sequence)
until the cost function does not change by a certain threshold. The output for
our example can be seen here:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we can see the value $ B = 0.01 $ and $ M = 518 $ yield a minimum $ SSR $ of
5.11. Now that we have the tools we can try to build our mathematical model.</p>
<h2 id="determining-the-effects-of-following-list-size--f--on-extended-network-growth">Determining the Effects of Following List Size ($ f $) on Extended Network Growth</h2>
<p><code>core/multi-extended-growth</code> changes the amount of nodes each node in the
network follows ($ f $), calculates the extended network growth, and writes
the results to
<a href="https://github.com/rxt1077/jr/blob/master/data/multi_extended_growth.csv">data/multi_extended_growth.csv</a>.
Plotting the data, we can see the effect on our logistic curve as we vary $ f $
from 10 to 90:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#b8860b">jr.core=&gt;</span> (<span style="color:#00a000">multi-extended-growth</span> (<span style="color:#a2f">range </span><span style="color:#666">10</span> <span style="color:#666">100</span> <span style="color:#666">10</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#b8860b">nil</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rxt1077/jr/master/data/multi_extended_growth.png" alt="Multi Extended Growth"></p>
<p>As we can see, increasing $ f $ appears to be shifting $ M $ to the left. This
is exactly what we would expect as a greater <code>:following</code> list would mean a node
achieves its maximum growth rate earlier.</p>
<p>To get a more precise model, we can also use our gradient descent
implementation to calculate $ B $ and $ M $ for networks grown with differing
values of $ f $. This is implemented in <code>core/multi-descent</code>. Unfortunately
there aren&rsquo;t a lot of values of $ f $ that we can work with. If we extend our
range of $ t $ values to $ 3000 $ we can fit the curve down to $ f = 3 $. The
maximum $ f $ we can work with is around $ 60 $ if we still want to have
enough of a curve to do a decent fit. Using <code>core/multi-extended-growth</code> and
<code>core/multi-descent</code> we can create graphs for $ B $ and $ M $ as functions of
$ f $:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#b8860b">jr.core=&gt;</span> (<span style="color:#00a000">multi-extended-growth</span> (<span style="color:#a2f">range </span><span style="color:#666">3</span> <span style="color:#666">60</span> <span style="color:#666">1</span>))

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#b8860b">nil</span>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rxt1077/jr/master/data/multi_descent_b.png" alt="B vs f"></p>
<p>As can be seen, the first few points still do not get a good fit with the
gradient descent method and the results are not great. The computation took
several hours and I had to use an external tool to fit plots which is mildly
annoying when you just spent a decent amount of time implementing a curve
fitter. All that being said, for a network size of $ 100 $ the time of
maximum growth, $ M $, can be predicted based on following list size, $ f $,
with the following equation:</p>
<p>$$ M = \frac{5000}{f} $$</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_function">rational function</a> makes
sense as one would expect it to be asymptotically bounded on each side. $ M $
should approach $ 0 $ as the following list, $ f $, increases and it should
start at infinity for an impossible following list size of zero.</p>
<p>$ B $ does not appear to change that much as $ f $ varies, with only a slight
linear upward trend with a slope of $ 0.0003 $.</p>
<p>If this conclusion seems underwhelming it&rsquo;s because it is. Even as I write
this I have partially implemented ideas for improvement. Before I expand this
and see if that $ 5000 $ constant can be expressed in terms of $ n $
($ \frac{n^2}{2} $ perhaps?) I&rsquo;d like to tighten up the results. I&rsquo;ve labeled
this post <em>Part 1</em> as I&rsquo;m planning on taking a better look soon.</p>
<h2 id="functional-programming-clojure-and-optimizing-gradient-descent">Functional Programming, Clojure, and Optimizing Gradient Descent</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is not only to learn more about gossip protocols as
used by Secure Scuttlebutt, but also to learn more about functional
programming and Clojure in particular. To that point, here are some reflections
on going through the process in Clojure:</p>
<h3 id="visualizing-gradient-descent-as-an-infinite-sequence">Visualizing Gradient Descent as an Infinite Sequence</h3>
<p>It took a moment to realize that the results of gradient descent can be
represented as an infinite sequence. It is so commonly thought of as a loop
with a breaking condition that the mind-shift was difficult. I found looking
at several implementations of the
<a href="https://blog.klipse.tech/clojurescript/2016/04/19/fibonacci.html">Fibonacci sequence in Clojure</a>
to be helpful in wrapping my head around it.</p>
<h3 id="optimizations-in-functional-programming">Optimizations in Functional Programming</h3>
<p>Originally I was incorrectly under the assumption that results from a pure
function (side effect free) were cached and if the parameters remained
unchanged the cached results would be used. For example, if I repeatedly
calculate the gradient of the same terms I expected a huge drop in the time the
function took the second and third time. This is not the default, but it can be
supported via <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/memoize">memoization</a>.
Trying it out I began to run into issues with the overhead of calling
functions. So much of what I was doing was simple math that may actually be
less expensive than making a function call. What I ended using on was
multi-arity functions where I pass the results of intensive calculations
(gradient or $ e^{-B(T-M)} $) if I have them available. If not, they are
calculated by the function.</p>
<h3 id="trending-towards-matrix-notation-and-numerical-methods">Trending Towards Matrix Notation and Numerical Methods</h3>
<p>Initially I wrote my partial derivative functions independently, <code>gradient/pdb</code>
and <code>gradient/pdm</code>, but when I wrote my gradient function, <code>gradient/grad</code>, I
returned a vector of results. In Clojure, it seems to make the most sense to
work on everything as a vector more akin to matrix notation in mathematics. In
fact if numerical methods are used<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> these functions could easily work on
arbitrary length vectors representing the parameters to a function that is
passed as a parameter. Thus, Clojure seems to nudge you in the direction of
creating a more general purpose gradient descent implementation and sometimes
punishes you for being too specific. My gut tells me the generalized solution
is the better way and if I were to do it again, I&rsquo;d make it less specific.</p>
<h2 id="prior-work">Prior Work</h2>
<p>Research does not occur in a vacuum and this project is no exception. There is
an excellent thesis on message passing via gossip protocols by Mohsen
Taghavianfar that can be found
<a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:829973/FULLTEXT01.pdf">here</a>. It
has a fantastic quote that I&rsquo;d like to address:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most investigations done in this field just assume that a logistic function is
necessarily involved, however, according to the best of my knowledge none of
them explain why we need such an assumption.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my case I started with the simulation, saw that the analysis was going to
be complex (remember we&rsquo;re simulating Secure Scuttlebutt meaning we have to
simulate the friend-of-friend nature of message passing <em>as well as</em> the
establishment of the friend-of-friend network), generated growth output for the
first part of my problem (network establishment), and saw that it looked like
a logistic. Due to the complexity, I did not attempt to attack this
analytically at first.</p>
<p>Taghavianfar does a great job reviewing previous work and he includes all of
the code for the simulation as well as the output. The references in the paper
are a great source for further exploration as well. I highly recommend reading
this work.</p>

<p>Several graphing tools were tried for this post including
<a href="https://plot.ly/">plotly</a>, <a href="">vegalite</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/incanter/incanter">incanter</a>. Both vegalite and plotly
seemed to cause too much javascript creep for a simple blog post (however it is
worth noting that this page uses <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>). Vegalite
also seemed incapable of the type of 3D plot needed for the cost function.
Incanter seemed to be a hefty dependency, especially when I was choosing to
implement gradient descent by hand.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>We could just increase the precision of <code>gradient/graph-ssr</code> and find the
minimum, but for the purposes of gaining more experience working in clojure,
implementing a basic gradient descent algorithm seemed prudent.

<p>The importance of an

because I changed the way I was using the logistic function or because the
network was different enough that my initial estimates no longer worked. Much
time could have been saved by implementing this earlier.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a>&#160;<a href="#fnref1:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
