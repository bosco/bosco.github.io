        <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started spending more time family camping than solo backpacking and this
has necessitated a change in the way I do things. A
<a href="http://jwbasecamp.com/Articles/SuperCat/">cat-food container alcohol stove</a>
and ziplock bag of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQVkNkL9nrw">dehydrated BBQ spaghetti</a> weren&rsquo;t
going to cut it anymore. Also, starting a fire, burning it down to coals,
heating a pan, and cooking dinner turned out to be a little too time consuming
for my fresh-from-the-playground toddlers. I decided I needed a family camp
cooking kit.</p>
<p>I was a little jealous of my friend Greg&rsquo;s kit as he turned a knob, flicked
lighter, and made coffee in mere minutes. I also realized that this project
would be a perfect opportunity to improve my 3D printing skills. So with the
power of craigslist, the contents of my garage, a spool of PLA, and access to a
<a href="https://downloads.makerbot.com/replicator2/MakerBot_Replicator2_brochure.pdf">MakerBot Replicator
2</a>,
I set out to make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_box">chuck box</a>.</p>
<h2 id="finished-product-first">Finished Product First</h2>
<h3 id="packed-up">Packed Up</h3>
<p><img src="https://using.tech/chuckbox/closed.jpg" alt="closed"></p>
<h3 id="open-and-cooking">Open and Cooking</h3>
<p><img src="https://using.tech/chuckbox/open.jpg" alt="open"></p>
<h2 id="the-stoves">The Stove(s)</h2>
<p>From the start, my heart was set on the venerable <a href="https://camping.lovetoknow.com/Coleman_425_Camping_Stove">Coleman
425</a>. You&rsquo;ll need a
stove that can run on gasoline when you&rsquo;re refueling at the bombed-out Shell
station in between waves of mutant zombie attacks. I mean, it&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>That being said, the convenience of a propane no-pump, no-preheat instant flame
is nice too. Luckily for me I found someone on craigslist selling <em>both</em> and
they already came pre-seasoned with some camp stickers.</p>
<p><img src="https://using.tech/chuckbox/stoves.jpg" alt="Stoves"></p>
<p>I decided to design my chuck box to fit either, which meant making it slightly
longer so the propane canister could fit on the side.</p>
<h2 id="the-box">The Box</h2>
<p>The box itself is made of leftover OSB from a shed, 1/4&quot; crown staples, liquid
nails adhesive, and glossy black paint. The box has one top compartment for a
stove and two large bottom compartments for fuel / supplies. I didn&rsquo;t divide it
further because I wanted to carry a large storage bin that could also be used as
a kitchen sink.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h2>
<p>After looking at my options for a top hinge, I decided that I would try to 3D
print as much of the hardware as possible. The top hinge was exotic enough to
warrant it and the other parts would be good practice.</p>
<h3 id="handle1">Handle<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></h3>
<div class="stl" data-src="https://using.tech/chuckbox/handle.stl" style="height: 300px"></div>
<p>I started designing this part in
<a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/a38wYQUDsrB-chuck-box-handle">Tinkercad</a> but
ran into issues when I wanted to chamfer an edge (nobody likes a handle digging
into their skin). After a little reading I decided to learn <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview">Fusion
360</a> and quickly turned
out a <a href="https://using.tech/chuckbox/handle.f3d">part</a> (<a href="https://using.tech/chuckbox/handle.stl">STL</a>).</p>
<p>The software that was distributed with the Replicator 2 that I was using was
<a href="https://support.makerbot.com/troubleshooting/makerbot-desktop-software/software-download/download_12190">MakerBot
Desktop</a>
and that is what I started with. I was hoping I would be able to use the newer
<a href="https://www.makerbot.com/3d-printers/apps/makerbot-print/">MakerBot Print</a> at
some point, but it turns out that this printer is <em>very</em> incompatible with much
anything else. The more I dug into it, the more I realized it would be a pain to
make this printer work with any open source slicers I may want to try. <a href="https://jessestevens.com.au/2019/10/20/configuring-cura-4-3-for-makerbot-replicator-2/">Not
impossible</a>
but definitely not easy. What had happened to the great &ldquo;open manufacturing&rdquo;
promise of the RepRap?</p>
<p>Proprietary software nonsense aside, I managed to get two 50% infill PLA handles
designed and printed. They peeled off the bed a bit, but I didn&rsquo;t know much
about bed adhesion at this point.</p>
<h3 id="top-hinge">Top Hinge</h3>
<div class="stl" data-src="https://using.tech/chuckbox/top_hinge.stl" style="height: 300px"></div>
<p>This was the first major part I designed entirely in Fusion 360 (
<a href="https://using.tech/chuckbox/top_hinge.f3d">f3d</a>, <a href="https://using.tech/chuckbox/top_hinge.stl">STL</a>). It was also the
reason for trying out 3D printing in the first place. I needed a hinge that
supported opening the top 270° so it would be out of the way of the stove. This
has the added bonus of making a little shelf on the other side of the chuck box
when you open it.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be a print-in-place hinge, but I couldn&rsquo;t get the printer to
bridge the distance the pin needed, so I chose to design a push-in pin for it
(pictured but ultimately not used). The supports generated by MakerBot Desktop
wouldn&rsquo;t work either so I designed and added break-off supports which also
required bridging but worked well (go figure).</p>
<p>The amount of play in my woodworking meant that a tight-fitting hinge pin was
not going to work. For a while I utilized bolts which barely fit and put a lot
of strain on the joint. One day in a 32℉ garage I learned what people meant when
they say PLA is brittle. The side of one of my hinges broke off and hit the
garage door.</p>
<p>Eventually I ended up drilling a 1/16&quot; hole in the end of a nail, cutting it to
length, and using a washer and wire to keep it from falling out. I would not
recommend this technique.</p>
<p><img src="https://using.tech/chuckbox/top_hinge_closeup.jpg" alt="Closeup of the Top Hinge"></p>
<h3 id="bottom-hinge">Bottom Hinge</h3>
<div class="stl" data-src="https://using.tech/chuckbox/bottom_hinge.stl" style="height: 300px"></div>
<p>For the fold down platform I would typically use a long piano hinge, so I
looked to Thingiverse to see what had been done before. Fortunately there was
a great <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1343501">parametric piano hinge</a>
available. I was yearning for some print-in-place goodness and wanted to try
<a href="https://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> as well.</p>
<p>I generated the longest hinge that the Replicator 2 could do and ran smack into
leveling and bed adhesion problems. I cleaned the bed, put down a layer of blue
tape, and leveled it. Adhesion improved greatly and I was able to make a long
hinge. Unfortunately the print tolerances were too poor for the hinge to be
able to move.</p>
<p>I made some modifications including a less thick pin and a larger gap between
the moving parts. The file can be found <a href="https://using.tech/chuckbox/bottom_hinge.scad">here</a>, but
it should be noted that I don&rsquo;t think my variables are fully &ldquo;parameterized&rdquo;. I
just changed the values in OpenSCAD and regenerated the
<a href="https://using.tech/chuckbox/bottom_hinge.stl">STL</a>.</p>
<h3 id="latch">Latch</h3>
<div class="stl" data-src="https://using.tech/chuckbox/latch.stl" style="height: 300px"></div>
<p>I started with <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2601090">this cam latch</a>
which I wasn&rsquo;t able to get to print <em>and</em> move. Next I found
<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3283176">this lockable latch</a> which worked
without any modification. <del>I didn&rsquo;t have metric bolts sitting around, so it&rsquo;s
currently held together with hitch pins. It&rsquo;s not the prettiest look and I may
change it as some point.</del> I ordered some metric bolts, see the second pic.</p>
<div class="row">
	<img class="column" src="https://using.tech/chuckbox/latch_closeup_1.jpg" style="height: 30%;">
	<img class="column" src="https://using.tech/chuckbox/latch_closeup_2.jpg" style="height: 30%;">
</div>
<h3 id="chain-and-anchor">Chain and Anchor</h3>
<div class="row">
    <div class="column stl" data-src="https://using.tech/chuckbox/link.stl" style="height: 150px;"></div>
    <div class="column stl" data-src="https://using.tech/chuckbox/anchor.stl" style="height: 150px;"></div>
</div>
<p>A chain and anchors are used to hold open the bottom lid. I made this after a
friend (remember Greg from the camp story in the first paragraph?) guilted me
in to really 3D printing as much hardware as I could.</p>
<p><img src="https://using.tech/chuckbox/chain.jpg" alt="Chain"></p>
<p>As this point we &ldquo;rediscovered&rdquo; a 3D printer at work (<a href="https://www.xyzprinting.com/en-US/product/da-vinci-2-0duo">da Vinci 2.0
Duo</a>) and I was asked
to see if I could get it printing again. If I thought that the MakerBot
Replicator 2 had been hamstrung by proprietary software, this thing from XYZ
Printing seems to have had a total amputation of its legs. Chipped filament,
terrible proprietary software, and an overflowing dumpster of incompatible
versions / bundles to choose from at that.</p>
<p>From a hardware perspective it had an extruder that wouldn&rsquo;t heat because they
used a SMD resistor as a fuse and it had &ldquo;blown.&rdquo; I <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/groups/xyz-printnig-da-vinci-20-duo/forums/general/topic:25541">stole power from the
bed</a>
and called it a day. Also from a hardware perspective the printer is an
Arduino, meaning some <a href="https://github.com/luc-github/Repetier-Firmware-4-Davinci">great open-source
firmware</a> exists for
it. I flashed that and now have a working printer.</p>
<p>For all my complaining about proprietary software, I was still designing in
Fusion 360: A program which won&rsquo;t even let you view a design unless you&rsquo;re
connected to the internet and it can phone home. I decided to learn to use
<a href="https://www.freecadweb.org">FreeCAD</a> to design these parts.</p>
<p>The design experience was excellent, FreeCAD is a great piece of software. The
printing experience had a bit of a learning curve as I was now using ABS, a
new printer, and was printing small parts. The end result looks
cool, but I may swap it out for an articulated arm. The chain flexes a little
more than I&rsquo;m comfortable with.</p>
<h3 id="update-lid-arms">Update: Lid Arms</h3>
<div class="stl" data-src="https://using.tech/chuckbox/arm_demo.stl" style="height: 300px;"></div>
<p>I ended up designing folding arms that could be attached to the side. They work
great with just enough flex to make up for imperfections while still making the
lid a much more usable workspace.</p>
<p><img src="https://using.tech/chuckbox/arms.jpg" alt="arms"></p>
<p>It also gave me the opportunity to use the
<a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/A2plus_Workbench">A2Plus</a> addon in FreeCAD to test
the assembly and make the demo you see above. The STL/FreeCAD files for each
part of the arms can be found here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right Arm Top (<a href="https://using.tech/chuckbox/R_arm1.stl">STL</a>|<a href="https://using.tech/chuckbox/R_arm1.FCStd">FCStd</a>)</li>
<li>Right Arm Bottom (<a href="https://using.tech/chuckbox/R_arm2.stl">STL</a>|<a href="https://using.tech/chuckbox/R_arm2.FCStd">FCStd</a>)</li>
<li>Left Arm Top (<a href="https://using.tech/chuckbox/L_arm1.stl">STL</a>|<a href="https://using.tech/chuckbox/L_arm1.FCStd">FCStd</a>)</li>
<li>Left Arm Bottom (<a href="https://using.tech/chuckbox/L_arm2.stl">STL</a>|<a href="https://using.tech/chuckbox/L_arm2.FCStd">FCStd</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bolt-knob">Bolt Knob</h3>
<div class="stl" data-src="https://using.tech/chuckbox/knob.stl" style="height: 300px;"></div>
<p>This is by far my favorite part in the whole build. I ended up making some legs
out of 2x4 scraps that I had lying around. Originally I had planned on holding
them in with a bolt and a <a href="https://www.grainger.com/product/1XGH6">t-nut</a>.
While contemplating how I should pack a wrench to tighten the bolt, I realized
that what I really needed was something that was easy to hand tighten. In a
half hour I made a <a href="https://using.tech/chuckbox/knob.FCStd">part in FreeCAD</a>. The next day I
printed it with tolerances just tight enough to keep the bolt from falling out.
The print turned out great as it was the first medium sized, flat bottomed,
non-articulating print since the handle. This part saved me carrying /
eventually losing four washers and a wrench.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I can see the appeal of wanting to be able to make just about anything out of
of plastic. That being said, 3D printing comes with its own heavy baggage of
domain specific knowledge and quirky software. You can also make just about
anything with a block of wood, a chisel, and wood working expertise. The
difference with 3D printing is that once the design work is done, it&rsquo;s really
easy to make your own copy. I&rsquo;d argue that 3D printing doesn&rsquo;t just facilitate
sharing, it creates an environment that demands it. I hope that you can use
some of these ideas / designs.</p>
